Models and examples that extend the MRST AD-OO framework found in the ad-core module to black-oil problems. More specifically, the module adds additional models that implement the black-oil equations for multiphase, miscible, compressible flow. Included in the module are also a wide variety of examples validating the solvers against a commercial simulator on standard test cases.
