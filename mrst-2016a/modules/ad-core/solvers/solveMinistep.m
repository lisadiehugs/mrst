function [state, converged, failure, its, reports] = solveMinistep(solver, model, state, state0, dt, drivingForces)
% Attempt to solve a single mini timestep while trying to avoid
% stagnation or oscillating residuals.
%
% Note: This is an internal function for the NonLinearSolver class that is
% exposed for testing purposes. Do not use directly, as the interface may
% disappear or change without prior notice. Instead, use
% NonLinearSolver.solveTimestep() instead.
