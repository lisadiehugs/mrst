classdef NonLinearSolver < handle
%Generalized Newton-like nonlinear solver
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   solver = NonLinearSolver()
%
%   solver = NonLinearSolver('maxIterations', 5)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The NonLinearSolver class is a general non-linear solver based on
%   Newton's method. It is capable of timestep selection and cutting based
%   on convergence rates and can be extended via subclassing or modular
%   linear solvers and timestep classes.
%
%   Convergence is handled by the PhysicalModel class. The NonLinearSolver
%   simply responds based on what the model reports in terms of convergence
%   to ensure some level of encapsulation.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS (supplied in 'key'/value pairs ('pn'/pv ...)):
%   Documented in methods section.
%
% RETURNS:
%   A NonLinearSolver class instance ready for use.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   simulateScheduleAD, LinearSolverAD, SimpleTimeStepSelector
