function C = Enu2C(E, nus, G)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function C = Enu2C(E, nus, G)
%
% DESCRIPTION: For each cell, construct the 3x3 (in 2D) or 6x6 (in 3D) matrix
% representing the elasticity tensor.
%
% In 3D, the matrix of the elasticity tensor for a given cell is written:
%
% |  1-nu  nu    nu    0          0          0         |
% |  nu    1-nu  nu    0          0          0         |
% |  nu    nu    1-nu  0          0          0         |            E         
% |  0     0     0     (1-2nu)/2  0          0         |  x  --------------
% |  0     0     0     0          (1-2nu)/2  0         |     (1+nu) (1-2nu)
% |  0     0     0     0          0          (1-2nu)/2 | 
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   E   - Young's modulus (one entry per cell)
%   nus - Poisson ratio (one entry per cell)
%   G   - Grid
%
% RETURNS:
%   C - (k,n) matrix, where k=3^2 (2D) or k=6^2 (3D), and n is the number of
%       cells.  Each row thus represents the entries of the elasticity tensor
%       for a specific cell.
