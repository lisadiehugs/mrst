continuum models aim at an averaged description of flow and transport in the fractured medium.
They are based on an upscaling procedure, which introduces effective coefficients for one or several interacting continua.
E.g. dual-porosity: matrix and fracture are upscaled into separate continua, which are coupled through a transfer term.
Complexity of the problem and degrees of freedom are drastically reduced → efficient, suitable for large scale problems
However, this efficiency comes at the cost of:
- losing information on the fine-scale
- additional assumptions → REV on the macro-scale, not only for matrix, but also for fractures, which is not always the case.
